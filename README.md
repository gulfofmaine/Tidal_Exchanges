# Tidal Exchanges: A Place for Community Discussions Around Better Science Practices

**About:**    
This is a repository for discussions around research team best practices following the Openscapes Champions Program. All input/feedback is encouraged!

## Organization

As the Openscapes program progresses we will meet as a team every other week to go over what was covered in the Openscapes lesson. Each section will be documented using [Issues](https://github.com/gulfofmaine/Tidal_Exchanges/issues).

As part of this project we will publish a lab manual and code of conduct that can be hosted online as a resource for current and future research team members.

That documentation can be found here: [GMRI Research Team Lab Manual](https://gulfofmaine.github.io/Tidal_Exchanges/docs/)
